# ðŸŒŸ Lara's Personal Portfolio

This is my portfolio, which has links to my socials, my 
resumÃ©, and displays a few personal projects I enjoy.

My personal portfolio doesn't contain the work I've done at 
[ion8](https://ion8.net), but I'm happy to discuss this with 
anyone who's interested! We're doing some pretty cool work 
over there.

## Development

1. Clone the repository with `git clone`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run Prisma Studio with `npx prisma studio`
4. Run the app with `npm run dev`
